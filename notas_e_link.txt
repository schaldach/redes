The subnet mask is used to differentiate the host and the network ID portion of the IP address. 
You can relate the IP address to your street address. The subnet mask defines the length of the street name.

one house on the same street, for example, house number 3, will have an address 192.168.0.3. The maximum 
number of houses on this street is 253, ranging from 2 to 254.
